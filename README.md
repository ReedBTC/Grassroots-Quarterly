# **Welcome**

Welcome to the Grassroots Quarterly Bitcoin Meetup Resources page! This is intended to host as many resources as possible for bitcoin meetup organizers around the world.

Running a bitcoin meetup can be a daunting undertaking and in many ways it is a big commitment. But building a community of local bitcoiners may be one of the most important and impactful things that you can do to advance bitcoin adoption and strengthen Bitcoin's most important security layer: the social consensus layer

Bitcoin is an open-source project and can be changed by anyone at any time. But, the bitcoin network runs on a social consensus of people who all agree what the rules of bitcoin are. As bitcoin continues to run, there will be future proposals for soft forks and hard forks and it is imperative that we have an active and educated social layer of bitcoiners who run the nodes and contribute economically to bitcoin by participating in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Bitcoin meetups are where we can continue to foster the development and education of new bitcoiners by offering a physical space for people to come together and share ideas, ask questions and learn from each other.

I hope that this page finds you well and offers you some tools that will help you start or continue your local bitcoin meetup.

Thank you for all that you do to advance bitcoin grassroots adoption!

# **Why Start or Continue a Bitcoin Meetup**

In many ways falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole can be a lonely path, especially when so many people you have tried to talk to about it so often dismiss it for any number of reasons. Sure, there are many opportunities to interact with friends and strangers on the internet, but real life interactions hit different in so many ways. Connecting with other bitcoiners IRL allows for immediate, deep conversations that skip superficial small talk, diving into shared beliefs about bitcoin, but also other so many other topics that we have all found on our path to find the truth, the signal through the noise.

Bitcoin meetups are a place where all of your friends are, even if you have never met them before. Bitcoiners are some of the most principled, devoted, and intellectually intelligent people I have ever met. Starting a bitcoin meetup is your opportunity to bring together all of the stranded bitcoiners in your area and to make each other stronger, smarter and more informed than we all are separately.

Beyond the softer, social reasons to run a bitcoin meetup, there are tangible benefits to connecting in real life that are impossible or extraordinarily complicated online.

- Local markets to exchange goods for sats
- Finding or fostering local businesses to accept sats for goods and services
- Bitcoin celebrations (halvings, pizza day, white paper day, genesis day, etc.)
- Hands on demos or workshops
- Meeting or connecting with developers or other industry leaders and experts

Ultimately, Bitcoin meetups are where we can continue to foster the development and education of new bitcoiners by offering a physical space for people to come together and share ideas, ask questions and learn from each other. It is also our opportunity to strengthen Bitcoin's most important security layer: the social consensus layer

Bitcoin is an open-source project and can be changed by anyone at any time. But, the bitcoin network runs on a social consensus of people who all agree what the rules of bitcoin are. As bitcoin continues to run, there will be future proposals for soft forks and hard forks and it is imperative that we have an active and educated social consensus layer of bitcoiners who run the nodes and economically contribute to the bitcoin base layer. Bitcoin meetups are a powerful tool for strengthening bitcoin's social consensus.

## **What are you Committing to as a Bitcoin Meetup Organizer**

Running a bitcoin meetup can be a daunting undertaking and in many ways it is a big commitment. But fortunately, if you are the organizer of your local meetup you are in control of how much you are committing to.

Running a bitcoin meetup can be as easy as posting a date, time and location of where you will be hanging out anyway! In that case your only real commitment is to show up! For meetup organizers just showing up, especially when you can do it consistently, gets you a good portion of the benefit of hosting your meetup!

The best advice for bitcoin meetup organizers is to pick a day/time that works for you and to show up at that time consistently at whatever frequency you can fit into your life. Most meetups meet monthly, but some meet more or less frequently, depending on the meetup organizer and what level of commitment they feel comfortable with.

As you start to give yourself more responsibility as a community leader, you will find what works for you, but it is important to remember why you are running the meetup, so keep your mission in mind as you continue on your meetup journey.

## **Disclaimers and Risks**

Unlike meeting others online, meeting in real life can come with real life risks that should not be underestimated or underappreciated. Unlike bitcoin, which is a non-physical asset that can be protected with nuclear grade security in the form of strong encryption, YOU _are_ a physical asset and you should always be aware of the risks that come with operating in the real world.

Do not take this warning as a guarantee that if you start a bitcoin meetup that you will be attacked or physically assaulted in some way. Physical attacks in bitcoin are real, however, the vast majority of bitcoin physical attacks occur when people know that you will be carrying large quantities of money on your person and generally occur when you are alone or isolated in some way.

Here are some operational security good practices for bitcoin meetup organizers

- Do not use your full first and last name
- Do not post or otherwise share your home address with anyone you don't know or trust
- Do not bring large quantities of bitcoin or cash to a meetup
  - Do not keep large quantities of bitcoin on mobile wallets that you have on your phone
  - If you have access to a well endowed lightning node on your phone, set daily or weekly transfer limits
  - Do not keep bitcoin on an exchange that you can access from your phone or set withdraw limits or white-listed addresses
- Consider adopting a geographically distributed multisig setup for your bitcoin cold storage
- Pay attention. If you notice someone watching people arrive or leave take additional precautions, warn others, or change the way you list or advertise your meetup
- If you start a telegram or signal group, be aware of scammers and impersonators who will join the group and try to get people to send them bitcoin
  - It can be a good practice not to share your telegram link publically... just share it in person when new people join.

Operating in the real world always comes with real world risks and bitcoiners are not the only group that is susceptible to these types of risks. Opsec is important for everyone, but remember that as a bitcoin meetup organizer you are advertising yourself to the world as a leader of a group focused on the best performing financial asset in history.

Taking on more responsibility and accountability can be extremely rewarding, but almost always comes with additional risk. 

# **How to Start a Bitcoin Meetup**

Starting a bitcoin meetup can be as easy as posting a date, time and location of where you will be hanging out anyway! And honestly, this is probably the best way to start out.

If you are just starting out, my recommendation would be to find a public social setting like a bar, coffee shop, library, or any other space that will allow people to meet up just to talk. As the meetup organizer, you should pick a time and location that work for you, but obviously times that work better for others are most likely outside of normal working hours and at locations that people are likely to be familiar with.

Once you start to get a group of people together you can all talk amongst yourselves about what make sense of how people would like to see the meetup grow and develop. If other people have requests for alternate times or locations, just remember that as the organizer it is up to you to continue to show up as consistently as possible, so you also have to be ok with whatever is requested. Other people are always welcome to start another meetup or offer to help organize your meetup on alternate days as long as they are going to also be committed to it.

## **Where to List your Bitcoin Meetup**

There are many places to post your bitcoin meetup and each of them will come with their own level of visibility. Some are free, others require a paid membership to list, some are more locally focused and all of them come with various tradeoffs.

Big picture, its actually kind of a pain to post your meetup in a bunch of different locations, so don't feel obligated to post in all of these places.

Here are some recommendations for where to post your meetup events:

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
- [Orange Pill App](https://www.orangepillapp.com/)
- [Evento](https://evento.so/)
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
- [Luma](https://luma.com/)
- Your Meetup's Website
- [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/)
- [Nostr](https://primal.net/home)

Many bitcoin meetups also start their own Telegram or Signal groups where they will also send out reminders and notifications of new events or to communicate side events or other fun things that other people in the group want to get the word out about. Personally, I have found that sometimes people may be reluctant to download and/or enable notifications on ANOTHER app, so I also started to collect email addresses so I can send out reminders that way and more people (especially older members) are more likely to see it.

## **How to Advertise your Bitcoin Meetup**

Most meetups do not advertise outside of simply posting them to any number of the sites listed in the section above; advertising is optional. However, if you are trying to get the word out about your meetup to try and gather up some more regular attendees here are some ideas of how to advertise your meetup.

- Post flyers where you host your meetup or in the surrounding area (old school)
- A box of business cards is actually quite cheap ~\$20 and you can put a QR code on them that links to your website, social media, meetup page or similar where they will be able to find where you post your upcoming meetups
- Start a social media account for your meetup and post announcements, reminders and photos or other media from past events
- There are several bitcoin podcasts that will read out boosts from podcasting 2.0 apps such as fountain or during live streams
  - [Rabbit Hole Recap](https://www.fountain.fm/show/VDaMppQRUBZioj2XkaLn) (21,000 sat minimum for a shoutout)
  - [Bitcoin And…](https://www.fountain.fm/show/eK5XaSb3UaLRavU3lYrI)

At the end of the day, most meetup hosts will most likely agree that word of mouth is by far the biggest way that new members join. So, remind your meetup group to invite their friends, family and coworkers to attend, and make sure that your meetup is friendly and welcoming to newcomers, regardless of where they are on their bitcoin rabbit hole adventure.

## **How to Find a Venue for your Meetup**

### **_Social Meetups_**

As discussed in the section on how to start a bitcoin meetup, finding a location for a social meetup, where it is just a group of people who come to hang out and talk about whatever is on their mind, finding a venue is pretty easy. Just find a public social setting like a bar, coffee shop, library, or any other space that will allow people to meet up just to talk.

As your meetup grows, you might find that some of these spaces get too crowded for your meetup to be inclusive and function properly, so you might look for a place that has a back or side room that you can either reserve or that is often not crowded that you can just kind of take over during your meetup.

### **_Educational Meetups_**

Finding a venue for an educational or Socratic Seminar style meetup can be much more challenging. Often you will be looking for a venue with a TV or projector that you can use to share content, watch videos or a space that is conducive to interviews or other talks / speeches. Finding these venues, outside of working hours at low or no cost can be a challenge.

Libraries are great, but you'll need to make sure that the space is equipped for your needs and can handle the number of people you expect. You will also often need to provide your contact information and indicate that your meetup is open to the public.

If you have meetup members who own local businesses or know people who own local businesses, sometimes they will donate a space for your meetup.

If all else fails, you can normally find a venue that will be willing to rent you a space, however, this may not be sustainable for smaller meetups. If you are interested in this option, see if you can get your meetup members to donate to your meetup before renting the space. Also, see the section on bitcoin meetup financial support.

# **How to Build a Meetup Website**

If you are looking to add some legitimacy to your meetup you might consider launching a meetup website.

If you're looking for a budget website you can host a simple HTML website on GitHub. This is not as hard as it sounds… my advice would be to read the how to guide and use an AI to walk you through the process if you are new to GitHub or if you have never had a website before.

- Here is a guide of how to host a website on GitHub
  - [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- Here is a meetup site repo you can fork
  - [BitDevsNYC](https://github.com/BitDevsNYC/BitDevsNYC.github.io)

There are also services who will build you a website; however, these are services you will need to pay for and vary significantly in price and quality. You can ask around on social media and will likely find other bitcoiners who would be willing to make you a website, but again, most will be looking for you to pay for their service. [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) is another option for finding resources who can build you a website on a budget. Consider working with AI to find a good option for you.

# **Get Support for your Bitcoin Meetup**

## **Community Support**

Bitcoin meetups are decentralized, which is good for independent content development, but not so good for coordination and support. Fortunately, there are several telegram groups you can join if you are a meetup organizer to get feedback on ideas, or to get support from the community of bitcoin meetup organizers

Reach out to me on telegram (@ReedBTC) and I will do my best to get you invited to these telegram groups if you run a meetup.

### **_Grassroots Bitcoin_**

Bitcoin Park hosts an annual event at bitcoin park in Nashville for bitcoin meetup organizers that is invite-only. This is a great opportunity to meet other meetup organizers to talk about lessons learned, feedback and to get and share ideas.

If you are currently running a bitcoin meetup the best way to get an invite to grassroots is to join their telegram channel and look out for the invite there.

Reach out to me on telegram (@ReedBTC) and I will do my best to get you invited to these telegram groups if you run a meetup.

### **_Grassroots Quarterly Roundtable_**

Grassroots Quarterly is a quarterly virtual meeting for bitcoin meetup organizers that started in July 2025 and was largely an outgrowth of the Grassroots 2025 meetup at Bitcoin Park in Nashville. It is an open forum for bitcoin meetup organizers to talk about challenges, share ideas, and collaborate to help each other improve and streamline their bitcoin meetup preparation and execution. Look out for the invites in the telegram groups mentioned above if you'd like to join our calls.

## **Financial Support**

Be prepared to spend more bitcoin than you bring in if you are a bitcoin meetup organizer… there are definitely ways to minimize cost, but ultimately, if you are a passionate leader, you will end up spending sats to get a meetup.com organizer account, make business cards, get an AI subscription, buy pizza or beer, rent a hall for a party or any number of other things you could do to make your meetup all that you hoped it would be.

By far the easiest way to get financial support for your meetup is to ask your members to donate! The Bitcoin and open-source development community relies on the concept of [value-4-value](https://value4value.info/). For those of you on nostr, you know that people like to send sats to content they get value from and your meetup is likely providing more value to your members than a silly meme or vlog post on nostr. Let your members know the cost of the meetup and ask them to contribute if you are planning a larger event.

### **_External Financial Support_**

External financial support for bitcoin meetups is thin at best. Occasionally companies in the bitcoin space may offer support, but this is generally for their local meetups or comes with strings attached like sharing referral links or similar to actually get financial benefits.

If you provide free and open-source content and/or come up with other interesting ways to spread bitcoin education or outreach through your bitcoin meetup, you could apply for an [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/) grant. Note that your project MUST HAVE a proper open-source license & educational materials must be available to the public under an open license in order to [apply](https://opensats.org/apply).

### **_Starting a Non-Profit_**

If you are serious about trying to bring in money, you could start a 501(c)(3) non-profit which would provide tax advantages to donors to your meetup. Note, however, that it can be difficult to find donors willing to contribute enough to offset the application costs and the additional accounting burden.

See [form1023.org](form1023.org) for help and instructions for setting up a non-profit.

### **_FAQs_**

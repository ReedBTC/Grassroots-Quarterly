## Contributing to Grassroots Quarterly

Hey, thanks for taking the time to contribute! You're awesome! 🎉

The goal of the Grassroots Quarterly project is to provide meetup organizers with tools, resources and good practices to help them start or maintain their bitcoin meetup

This page is intended to only be edited by bitcoin meetup organizers or others with experience with in-person technical or social meetups; however, it is open to all, even if you're new!

### Before you start

* Make yourself familiar with the existing content in the README.md file
* Join our Telegram chat group (DM @ReedBTC on telegram for an invite)
* Have a look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/ReedBTC/Grassroots-Quarterly/issues)

## How to Contribute (Even if You’re New!)

1. **Fork the Repo**: Click “Fork” at the top right of [our repo](https://github.com/ReedBTC/Grassroots-Quarterly) to make your own copy.
2. **Edit Easily**: Use GitHub’s web editor—click a file (like README.md), hit the pencil icon to add tips or fix typos, then scroll down to “Commit changes.”
3. **Start a Branch**: Name it something simple (e.g., “add-venue-tip”) when committing!
4. **Open a Pull Request**: After committing, GitHub will prompt you to [create a pull-request](https://github.com/ReedBTC/Grassroots-Quarterly/pulls). Add a short note (e.g., “Added a venue finding tip”) and submit.
5. **We’ll Help**: We’ll review and chat with you in the PR comments if needed.

- Keep it Bitcoin-focused and spam-free.
- Feel free to credit yourself (CC0 allows it but doesn’t require it).
